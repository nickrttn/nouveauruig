			<p>This is Placemat! An interactive tour through Amsterdam's De Pijp neighbourhood. We guide you through the neighbourhood and at the end, you'll have all the ingredients you need to cook a great recipe. The recipes are all fit for 2 people.</p>

			<p>We’re a group of students from the Netherlands. For our school HvA (the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences), we were tasked to build a website that details one or multiple guided routes throughout our appointed district. After some time our focus became clear, We were going to make a tour through the Amsterdam district called “de Pijp” for lovers of the culinary art.</p>

			<p>After 6 weeks of development time the result is the website you currently have in front of you. Through this we hope to be able to speak to every lover of the culinary arts with our special blend of multi-cultural dishes, ingredients and their rich history.</p>

            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <h4>Checklist</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Beef</li>
                <li>French pastry</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>tablespoons Olive oil</li>
                <li>Thyme</li>
                <li>a little flour for dusting</li>
                <li>a bottle of red wine</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preperation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the beef in a pan and brush with 1tbsp olive oil. Season the beef with pepper and toast it for 15 minutes for medium-rare or 20 minutes for rare. When the beef is cooked, deglaze it with the red wine bought at vintner Van Krimpen and let it cool. Then move the beef to the fridge to chill for about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place 2 pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 pieces of prosciutto on the cling film, and let them slightly overlap in a double row. Spread half of the duxelles over the prosciutto and place the fillet on it. Spread the remaining duxelles over and use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet. Roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of the cling film to tighten it as you go. Let the fillet chill while you start rolling out the pastry.</li>
                <li>Put a bit of flower on your work surface and roll out a third of the puff pastry to a 18x30xm strip, now place it on a non-sticking baking sheet. Roll out the remaining puff pastry out, to about 28x36 cm. Unravel the fillet from the cling film and place it on the center of the smaller strip of pastry. Beat 2 egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of water and use this to brush the edges, top and side of the pastry. Use a rolling pin to carefully lift and drape the large piece of pastry over the fillet. Press it well into the sides and trim the joints to about 4 cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a spoon or fork handle and glaze some more egg yolk. Now mark the Beef Wellington with long diagonal lines with the back of a knife and make sure you do not cut into the pastry. Let it chill for at least 30 min up to 24 hours.</li>
                <li>When ready, heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas and brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk. Let it cook until it’s golden crisp. 20-25 minutes for medium-rare beef and 30 minutes for medium. When done, allow the Beef Wellington to stand for 10 minutes before serving. Slice in thick slices.</li>
            </ol>
